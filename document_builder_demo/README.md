# Document Builder

## Project description
Rough document builder made with vue.js and bootstrap through bootstrap-vue.js
Save feature currently prints a JS object to the console describing the document.
Rows can't be moved or remove. In order to remove a Row the entire document needs to be scrapped. Adding a feature to remove individual rows shouldn't be dificult.
Text and Headings are editable, all other elements are not. Images get a random image from picsum.photos. Dropdown menu's have 3 preset options, input fields have preset placeholders. Making all components editable shouldn't be difficult to do.
